# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

In this project I was tasked with creating an application to a web page including a generate random password button. This application enabled  employees to randomly generate a password with the click of a button and a few criteria requests to determine what the length and character types that will be included in the employees new password. I learned the use of if/else conditional statements and for statements to and the benefit to variables and key-value objects.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

The steps towards installing this application to the web page iclude:
first cloning to starter code into my own personal repository
Next making sure I have all neccessary files in order for expected application to run according to its design (Html, CSS, Javascript)
The Js file is where I am tasked to add a function so once I have cloned and commited my new code in my repository I can begin deducing where I need to focus my attention.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
